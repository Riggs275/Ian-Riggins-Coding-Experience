## <u>About Me</u>

Hello, my name is Ian Riggins, I am a college student attending Kennesaw State University pursuing a bachelor's degree majoring in Software Engineering and minoring in Mathematics.

I have experience in HTML, C++, SQL, Java, and C# the last two of which are my main languages and the ones I am best in. 

## <u>Projects</u>

In this GitHub repository you'll be able to find some various programs I have written. This includes:

- **bucketSorting**: This is a Java application that allows the user to input integers into an array, sort the array using the bucket/radix sort algorithm, and get the integer array in its unsorted and sorted state.

- **testStack**: A Java application that implements functions to manipulate stack data structures. These functions include: 

  - *topToBottom* - A function that takes in a stack of integers as a parameter and displays the stack contents from the top of the stack to the bottom of the stack (the top value is printed first and the bottom is printed last) without change the content of the stack.

  - *bottomToTop* - A function that takes in a stack of doubles as a parameter and displays the stack contents from bottom to top (the bottom value is printed first and the top value is printed last) without changing the content of the stack.

  - *flipStack* - A function that takes in a stack of strings as a parameter and returns the stack with content reversed.

  - *searchStack* - A search function that takes in a stack of integers and a target values and returns true or false depending on if the value is found or not without changing the content of the stack.
  
- **Web-Based Calculator** - A semester long project where I created a web-based calculator along with unit tests and end-to-end tests for the program. The repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Riggs275/Ian-Riggins-SWE-3643-Project).
