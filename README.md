## <u>About Me</u>

Hello, my name is Ian Riggins, I am a college student attending Kennesaw State University pursuing a bachelor's degree majoring in Software Engineering and minoring in Mathematics.

I have experience in HTML, C++, SQL, Java, and C# the latter of which being my most proficient languages. 

## <u>Projects</u>

Located in the [Projects folder](https://github.com/Riggs275/Ian-Riggins-Coding-Experience/tree/main/Projects) of this repository you'll be able to find some various programs I have written. This includes:

### C# 

- **Bank Account Manager** - A collection of C# programs demonstrating my C# skills in regards to Polymorphism/Inheritance, the List data structure, and Exception Handling.
- **TimedSelectionSort** - A simple program that creates and sorts an array that sorts through 1000 arrays of random integers and calculates the average time in milliseconds.
- **Web-Based Calculator** - A semester long project where I created a web-based calculator along with unit tests and end-to-end tests for the program. The repository for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Riggs275/Ian-Riggins-SWE-3643-Project).

### Java 
- **bucketSorting**: This is a Java application that allows the user to input integers into an array, sort the array using the bucket/radix sort algorithm, and get the integer array in its unsorted and sorted state.

- **testStack**: A Java application that implements functions to manipulate stack data structures. These functions include: 

  - *topToBottom* - A function that takes in a stack of integers as a parameter and displays the stack contents from the top of the stack to the bottom of the stack (the top value is printed first and the bottom is printed last) without change the content of the stack.

  - *bottomToTop* - A function that takes in a stack of doubles as a parameter and displays the stack contents from bottom to top (the bottom value is printed first and the top value is printed last) without changing the content of the stack.

  - *flipStack* - A function that takes in a stack of strings as a parameter and returns the stack with content reversed.

  - *searchStack* - A search function that takes in a stack of integers and a target values and returns true or false depending on if the value is found or not without changing the content of the stack.

### SQL

- **SuperVacuumStore** - A project I worked on where I worked for a hypothetical vacuum manufacturing company to create regular and normalized Entity-Relationship Diagrams and converted them into tables using SQL. Some requirements for this project included:
  - ER Diagrams
    - Vacuums
      - Serial Number (Primary Key)
      - Manufacturing Completion Date
    - Vacuum Model Details
      - Identification Number (Primary Key)
      - Name
      - Color
      - Price
    - Designer Information
      - Name
      - Contact Information
        - Email
        - Phone Number
        - Address
          - Street Number
          - Street Name
          - City
          - State
          - Zip Code
      - Technicians
        - Employee Number (Primary Key)
        - Name
        - Age
        - Employment Date
        - Phone Number
        - Address
      - Two different inspections
        - Verification Date
        - Inspected By
        - Inspection Grade
  - SQL Tables
    - Creating at least 10 fake records for each table by writing queries.
    - Retrieving the model of each vacuum along with its price.
    - Retrieving the number of vacuums that have a manufacture date after 2010
    - Retrieving the name of the technician who inspected the most vacuums.
    - Retrieving the vacuum models who received an "average" grade (along with the date of verification).
    - Retrieving each vacuum's serial number, designer name, and technician name.



## Disclaimers

- This repository will be updated over time as I tackle various personal and school-related projects.
- At the time of creating this repository this is my first time working with Markdown and GitHub so this repository might have many commit changes that change next to nothing.
